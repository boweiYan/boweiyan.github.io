\section*{Question 1}
Given a list of $m$ positive real numbers $\bm{x}=[x_1,\cdots, x_m]$, write a function to check if there exists a $n\times n$ matrix $X$ that satisfies:
\begin{itemize}
\item $X$ is symmetric;
\item $X$ is rank-1;
\item all numbers in $m$ appear in $X$ once and only once;
\item all other elements in $X$ are 0.
\end{itemize}
Write the algorithm and analyze its complexity.
\paragraph{Solution:}
The idea is to use the fact that $X=aa^T$, so one chooses a subset of $\bm{x}$ to put on the diagonal, and solve the off-diagonal, and check if that is a superset of the remainder of $\bm{x}$.

\subsection*{--Extension}
Can you show your algorithm is optimal?
\paragraph{Solution:}
For the simple version there might be a theoretical limit. I don't have the answer yet.

\subsection*{--Harder version 1}
Given a list of $m$ real numbers $\bm{x}=[x_1,\cdots, x_m]$ ({\bf can be either positive or negative}), write a function to check if there exists a $n\times n$ matrix $X$ that satisfies:
\begin{itemize}
\item $X$ is symmetric;
\item $X$ is rank-1;
\item all numbers in $m$ appear in $X$ once and only once;
\item all other elements in $X$ are 0.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Solution:}
Off-diagonal solution is not unique, complexity should increase by constant factor.

\subsection*{--Harder version 2}
Given a list of $m$ positive real numbers $\bm{x}=[x_1,\cdots, x_m]$, write a function to check if there exists a $n\times n$ matrix $X$ that satisfies:
\begin{itemize}
\item $X$ is symmetric;
\item $X$ is rank-1;
\item all numbers in $m$ appear in $X$ once and only once;
\item other elements in $X$ can be arbitrarily chosen.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Solution:}
I don't have a polynomial time algorithm to this yet, would be interesting to discuss with smart candidates.
